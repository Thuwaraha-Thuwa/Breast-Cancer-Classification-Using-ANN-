🚀 Project Spotlight: Breast Cancer Classification Using Neural Networks

I’m excited to share my latest project where I developed a neural network model to classify breast cancer as malignant or benign, achieving 98% training accuracy and 97% validation accuracy.

🩺 Why This Matters:  My project offers a reliable solution for early detection based on medical data.Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers worldwide, 
and early detection is critical for saving lives. I developed a neural network model to classify breast cancer as malignant or benign based on medical data.

🔧 Technology Stack: TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Pandas

📊 Key Steps:

Collected and preprocessed data (e.g., Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset).
Designed a neural network with multiple hidden layers and ReLU activation.
Trained and evaluated the model with impressive results.
🏆 Results:
Achieved high accuracy and validated the model's effectiveness through metrics like precision and recall.
